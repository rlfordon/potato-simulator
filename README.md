# Potato Simulator

An HTML5 canvas game where you play as a brave potato battling evil kitchen utensils across 8 levels.

Game sprites and game design by Calvin (age 8).

## How to Play

- **Move:** Arrow keys or WASD
- **Attack:** Spacebar
- **Recruit allies:** E

Battle your way through 8 kitchen zones — from the Sink to the Dough Counter — fighting forks, knives, spoons, and terrifying bosses like the Mixer, Deep Fryer, and Evil Pizza. Recruit food allies (carrots, broccoli, tomatoes, and more) to fight alongside you.

## Play

**[Play Potato Simulator](https://rlfordon.github.io/potato-simulator/)** — runs right in your browser!

Or clone the repo and serve it locally (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`) — no dependencies, no build step. Note: opening the HTML file directly via `file://` won't load the sprites due to browser CORS restrictions.
